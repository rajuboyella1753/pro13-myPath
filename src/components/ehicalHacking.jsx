      <h3>Description : </h3>
        <p>Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to penetrate computer systems, networks, or software to identify security vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, use the same techniques as malicious hackers but with permission and legal approval. Their goal is to strengthen security by finding weaknesses before cybercriminals can exploit them. Ethical hacking plays a critical role in cybersecurity, helping organizations protect sensitive data, improve system defenses, and ensure compliance with legal and industry standards.
        Ethical hacking is the practice of legally testing systems for vulnerabilities to enhance security. It helps organizations prevent cyberattacks by identifying weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

      <p><i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i> White hat hacking, also known as ethical hacking, refers to the practice of intentionally probing systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in order to improve their security. Unlike malicious hackers (often called black hat hackers), white hat hackers have permission from the system owner to perform these activities and use their skills for legal and beneficial purposes.</p>
      <h5><b>Key Points About White Hat Hacking:</b></h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
      <i><span>Purpose:</span>  The goal of white hat hacking is to find and fix security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. They help organizations strengthen their security defenses and protect sensitive data.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span> Penetration Testing:</span> One of the main activities white hat hackers perform is penetration testing (pen testing), where they simulate attacks on a system to discover weaknesses that might otherwise be overlooked.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span>Authorization:</span>  Ethical hackers always have authorization to test the security of a system. This distinguishes them from black hats, who break into systems without permission.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span> Techniques Used:</span> White hat hackers use many of the same tools and techniques as malicious hackers, such as exploiting software bugs, cracking passwords, or network sniffing. The difference is that they do it ethically, with the aim of identifying and reporting vulnerabilities.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span> Certifications:</span> Many white hat hackers earn certifications like Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), or CompTIA PenTest+ to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in ethical hacking.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span> Bug Bounty Programs:</span> Some companies run bug bounty programs, where they reward white hat hackers for finding and reporting security vulnerabilities in their systems. Major tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple have such programs.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span> Legal and Ethical Boundaries:</span> White hat hackers must adhere to strict legal and ethical guidelines. They should only test systems where they have permission and should never exploit vulnerabilities they find for personal gain.</i>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i><span>Malicious Intent:</span> Black hat hackers break into systems without permission to steal data, cause damage, or disrupt operations.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span>Illegal Activities:</span>Their actions are unlawful and can lead to legal consequences such as imprisonment or fines.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span>Common Motives:</span>Financial gain, personal revenge, or simply causing chaos are typical motivations for black hat hacking.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span>Techniques Used: </span>They use various methods like malware, phishing, exploiting software vulnerabilities, and ransomware attacks.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i><span>Data Theft and Exploitation: </span>Black hat hackers often steal sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, personal identities, or proprietary business information, to sell on the dark web.</i>
        </li>
        <li><i><span>Ransomware:</span></i> Some black hats use ransomware to encrypt a victim's data</li>

    <h5><b>Key Points About Grey Hat Hacking:</b></h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <i><span>Unauthorized Access: </span>Grey hat hackers often access systems without permission but do not have malicious intent like black hats.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Ethical Ambiguity:</span>While they aim to report or fix vulnerabilities, grey hats donâ€™t always follow proper legal or ethical channels, leading to a blurry line between right and wrong.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Public Disclosure: </span>Some grey hats publicly disclose the vulnerabilities they find, often pressuring organizations to take action. This can sometimes put the system at further risk if not handled carefully.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>No Malicious Motives: </span>Unlike black hat hackers, grey hats do not exploit the vulnerabilities for personal gain or harm but instead aim to improve security.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Legal Risks:</span> Even though they may have good intentions, grey hat hacking is still illegal because it involves unauthorized access to systems or data.</i>

      <li><i><span>Deceptive Emails or Messages: </span></i>Phishing often involves sending fake emails or messages that seem to come from trusted sources, such as banks, social media platforms, or other reputable companies.</li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Personal Information Theft:</span>The goal of phishing is to trick individuals into providing sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or Social Security numbers.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Spoofed Websites: </span> Phishing attacks often direct users to fake websites that look identical to real ones, prompting them to enter personal information that is then stolen.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Malware Delivery: </span>Some phishing attacks include malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, install malware onto the victim's device, allowing attackers to gain further access or control.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i><span>Social Engineering: </span> Phishing relies heavily on social engineering tactics, manipulating people's trust, fear, or urgency to trick them into taking action without thinking carefully.</i>

        A gray hat hacker operates in a legal and ethical gray area, hacking systems without permission but without malicious intent. Unlike black hats, they donâ€™t exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain, and unlike white hats, they lack authorization. Gray hats often find and report vulnerabilities to system owners, sometimes publicizing them, but their actions are still illegal since they access systems without proper consent.
