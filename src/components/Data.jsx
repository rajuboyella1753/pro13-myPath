        <h1>Data Scientist</h1> 
          <p> <b>Introduction  </b> : A *Data Scientist* is a professional who analyzes and interprets complex data to help organizations make informed decisions. Their work involves a combination of skills in mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge. Data scientists are essential in today’s data-driven world because they turn raw data into actionable insights that businesses use to grow and improve.
The first step in a data scientist’s role is **data collection**. They gather data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or web scraping. This data can come from customer transactions, social media, sensors, or other digital platforms. The goal is to collect enough data to analyze and find useful patterns.
Once the data is collected, **data cleaning** is crucial. This step involves removing errors, filling in missing values, and organizing the data. Since real-world data is often messy and incomplete, data scientists spend a significant amount of time making it clean and usable.
Next, they perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. This involves analyzing and visualizing the data to uncover trends, relationships, and potential anomalies. During this stage, data scientists might use tools</p>
